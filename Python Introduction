- Simplicity
- Readability
- Developer productivity

Python allows programmers to focus on **problem-solving and logic** instead of complex syntax or hardware-level details.

Python is widely used in:
- Software Development
- Web Development
- Data Science
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Automation
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Cybersecurity

## ⚙️ Core Features of Python

### 1️⃣ Simple and Readable Syntax
- Python syntax closely resembles English
- Easy to read, write, and maintain
- Reduces logical and syntax errors

```python
print("Hello World")

### 2️⃣ Interpreted Language

Python is an **interpreted language**, which means:

- Code is executed **line by line**
- No separate compilation step is required
- Errors are detected immediately during execution

**Advantages:**
- Easy debugging
- Faster testing
- Quick development cycle

This makes Python ideal for beginners and rapid application development.

### 3️⃣ High-Level Programming Language

Python is a **high-level language**, which means:

- It hides hardware-level details
- No need to manage memory manually
- Programmer focuses only on logic and problem-solving

**Benefits:**
- Increased productivity
- Reduced complexity
- Cleaner and more understandable code

---

### 4️⃣ Dynamically Typed Language

Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning:

- No need to declare data types explicitly
- Data type is decided at runtime

```python
x = 10
x = "Python"
